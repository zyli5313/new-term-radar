"""Signal ⑥: products people pay for, rising (TrustMRR).

A product that makes money proves the demand behind it. TrustMRR lists startups whose revenue
is read from their payment provider (Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Polar, Creem, Paddle and others).
With a TrustMRR API key this reads, once a week by default (revenue.weekday, 0 = Monday):

- the fastest growing over the last 30 days, among those with at least `min_revenue_usd` in that time;
- the most recently listed, which mostly earn next to nothing yet: they are read to record where
  they start;

and keeps what it saw, so a product that made nothing last time and earns past the floor now is
called out first (the habit: "zero last month, or surging: look at those first"). Each product becomes a lead, with its own description handed to the keyword table as
evidence: the table then reads the job people pay for ("ai headshot generator"), not only the
brand. A run is `pages_growth + pages_new` requests; a standard key allows 10 a minute.

TrustMRR's API policy forbids bulk republication and public SEO pages built from its data: the
leads are for your own research, do not publish the list. Key: TRUSTMRR_API_KEY.
